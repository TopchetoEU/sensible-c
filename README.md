# Sensible C
A project that implements some nice-to-have functions for C

# Versions
Be careful which version you include. Sensible C has two versions: major and minor. Sensible C may dramaticlaly change from one major version to another so the program should expect a specific major version to work with. Minor versions are increased when just new functionality is added. If the program's minor version is less than the currently present, it is okay, since there aren't any breaking changes from monor version to another.

# Documentation
For now, it is inexistant. Soon, a detailed documentation of how to utilise this library will be written. I'm well-aware of the bad names of the functions, so in future versions, macros will be added to make the code more readable (if that's your thing)
